# Hungry-Hippos

# Description
Web application for searching and creating a grocery list based off of a specific dish. 
https://squiddotjpeg.github.io/Hungry-Hippos/

# Features

## Home Page

Here on the home page you can search for a meal you would like to prepare and it will bring up a list of related meals! Pretty nifty but it gets even better by allowing you to store all the ingredients from that recipe into a list that you can take with you when you go grocery shopping. On top of that you don't have to worry about accidentally closing the site because your list is stored in your local storage! You can access the list from this page aswell as the Find My Grocery store page and a Hot Recipe search. Finally you can also change your search options to fit your search better with the modal accessed by pressing the gear icon.

## Find My Grocery Store

This simple page will find the nearest grocery store to you and give you the address of it! Just one quick search and you are on your way!
